The joke really embarrassed Sarah. His apology made things worse.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Listen to David's apology. Can you tell what went wrong?

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
<v David>Sorry she got upset. It was only a joke.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.500
We were at a party. What I am supposed to do? Just sit quietly?

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:14.000
Everybody else thought it was funny. It's not a big deal.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
If she feels like I did something wrong, I'm sorry she feels that way.
